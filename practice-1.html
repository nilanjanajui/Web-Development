        <p>I'm David Leiter, the guy behind this website. I'm an American who's been traveling the world full time for 9 years now.
            I started this travel blog in 2019 to document my own international trips, share my photos, and help others learn how to travel 
            the world and find some really good spots off the beaten path. All of the writing and pictures on this site come from my own personal 
            experience. My second home is Bali, Indonesia, where I met my wife Intan, who's a Bali local. Now she joins me on these adventures too. 
            Together, we've done some bucket list hikes, climbed active volcanoes, seen exotic wildlife, and visited some spectacular castles, 
            temples, and monuments around the world.
