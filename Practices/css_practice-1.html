        <h3><i>Home of the Brave</i></h3>
        <p style="color:navy; background-color:darkkhaki;">In dreamlike sequences, a man symbolically confronts the trauma of
            his family's incarceration in the Japanese internment camps during
            World War II. This infamous event is made emotionally clear through
            his meeting a group of children all with strange name tags pinned to
            their coats. The man feels the helplessness of the children.
            Finally, desperately he releases the name tags like birds into the
            air to find their way home with the hope for a time when Americans
            will be seen as one people-not judged, mistrusted, or segregated
            because of their individual heritage. Sixty years after thousands of
            Japanese Americans were unjustly imprisoned, the cogent prose and
            haunting paintings of renowned author and illustrator Allen Say
            remind readers of a dark chapter in America's history.</p>

        <h3><i>Hachiko: The True Story of a Loyal Dog</i></h3>
        <p id="hachiko">Imagine walking to the same place every day, to meet your best
            friend. Imagine watching hundreds of people pass by every morning
            and every afternoon. Imagine waiting, and waiting, and waiting. For
            ten years. This is what Hachiko did. Hachiko was a real dog who
            lived in Tokyo, a dog who faithfully waited for his owner at the
            Shibuya train station long after his owner could not come to meet
            him. He became famous for his loyalty and was adored by scores of
            people who passed through the station every day. This is Hachiko's
            story through the eyes of Kentaro, a young boy whose life is changed
            forever by his friendship with this very special dog. Simply told,
            and illustrated with Yan Nascimbene's lush watercolors, the legend
            of Hachiko will touch your heart and inspire you as it has inspired
            thousands all over the world.</p>

        <h3><i>Shooting at the Stars</i></h3>
        <p class="highlight">Shooting at the Stars is the moving story of a young British soldier
            on the front lines during World War I who experiences an
            unforgettable Christmas Eve. In a letter home to his mother, he
            describes how, despite fierce fighting earlier from both sides,
            Allied and German soldiers ceased firing and came together on the
            battlefield to celebrate the holiday. They sang carols, exchanged
            gifts, and even lit Christmas trees. But as the holiday came to a
            close, they returned to their separate trenches to await orders for
            the war to begin again.John Hendrix wonderfully brings this story to
            life, interweaving fact and fiction along with his detailed
            illustrations and hand-lettered text. His story celebrates the
            humanity and kindness that can persist even during the darkest
            periods of our history. Back matter includes a glossary, additional
            information about World War I and the Christmas Truce and its
            aftermath, and an archival photograph taken during the Truce.</p>
