# Web Development Learning Repository

This repository represents my ongoing journey into web development, with a focus on building a solid foundation through hands-on practice and structured projects.

At this stage, I am learning **HTML** and **CSS**, emphasizing best practices for semantic markup, responsive layouts, and maintainable styling. As part of this process, I have developed a website called **Knowledge Vault**, which serves as a practical application of the concepts learned so far.

As I progress, this repository will expand to include **JavaScript** and more advanced front-end development concepts.
