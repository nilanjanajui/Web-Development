# 📱 Payoo – Frontend Mobile Banking Web App

Payoo is a **frontend-only mobile banking simulation** built with **HTML, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and vanilla JavaScript**.
The project focuses on **core frontend fundamentals** such as state management, input validation, DOM manipulation, and clean file separation — without using any frameworks or backend services.

This project is designed to be **portfolio-ready** and easy to understand for reviewers and recruiters.

## 🚀 Features

* Secure login (demo-based)
* Add money from bank
* Cashout to agent
* Live balance update
* Transaction history (in-memory)
* Modular JavaScript architecture
* Mobile-first responsive UI

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

The project follows a **simple layered architecture** using classic `<script>` files:

```
UI (HTML)
│
├── machine.js    → Shared DOM & balance utilities
├── state.js      → Global application state
│
├── login.js      → Login logic
├── addMoney.js   → Add money flow
├── cashout.js    → Cashout flow
├── history.js    → Transaction rendering
```

Each JavaScript file has **one clear responsibility**, making the project easy to extend and maintain.

---

## 🗂 File Responsibilities

### `index.html`

* Login page UI
* Loads `login.js`

### `home.html`

* Main dashboard UI
* Sections for Add Money, Cashout, and Transaction History
* No business logic inside HTML

### `machine.js`

Shared utility functions:

* `getValueFromInput(id)`
* `getBalance()`
* `setBalance(value)`
* `showOnly(sectionId)`

This file centralizes DOM access and balance handling.

---

### `state.js`

Manages application state:

```js
window.transactions = [];

window.addTransaction = function (type, amount, meta) {
    // stores transaction objects
};
```

Acts as an **in-memory database** similar to how real applications manage state.

---

### `addMoney.js`

* Validates user input
* Updates account balance
* Logs transactions using `addTransaction()`

---

### `cashout.js`

* Validates agent number, amount, and PIN
* Prevents overdraft
* Logs cashout transactions

---

### `history.js`

* Reads transaction data from global state
* Dynamically renders transaction cards
* Does not mutate state

---

## 🧾 Transaction Model

Each transaction is stored in the following format:

```js
{
  id: UUID,
  type: "ADD_MONEY" | "CASHOUT",
  amount: number,
  meta: { bank | agent },
  date: string
}
```

This structure mirrors **real-world fintech audit logs**.

## 🔐 Demo Login Credentials

```
Mobile Number: 01234567890
PIN: 1234
```

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* HTML5
* Tailwind CSS
* DaisyUI
* Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

No frameworks. No backend. No shortcuts.

---

## 🎯 Why This Project Is Portfolio-Ready

✔ Clean separation of concerns

✔ Realistic banking flows

✔ State management without frameworks

✔ Defensive input validation

✔ Scalable file structure

This project demonstrates **how the developer thinks**, not just how the UI looks.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Persist transactions using `localStorage`
* Replace `alert()` with custom toast notifications
* Add filters to transaction history
* Backend API integration
